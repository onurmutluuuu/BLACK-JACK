# BLACK-JACK

Our aim here is to show people addicted to gambling how harmful gambling actually is.

You initially start the game with $100.

You can start the game with any amount of dollars you want. However, if the amount you choose is more than your money, it will give a warning and ask you to choose the money again.

If you click "Enter" at the end of the hand, you will continue the game. If you write "NO" on the screen that appears, you will exit the game and you will see your profit-loss amount.

If you have no money left, you will be kicked out of the game.

However, you will see that after some time, your money will constantly be reduced to 0. This will reveal your luck in gambling.
